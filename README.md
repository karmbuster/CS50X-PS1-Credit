# CS50X-PS1-Credit
CS50X Class - Problem Set 1 - Credit Card Validator

This program uses <cs50.h> to simplify getting input from the keyboard.
It prompts the user for a credit card number and figures out if the card number is valid for Mastercard, Visa, or American Express using the length, the first and sometimes second digit, and Luhn's Algorithm.
It will output a string of the credit card company name if valid or INVALID if invalid.
